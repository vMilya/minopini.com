I'm very much a first principles person and often end up with thoughts that are contrary to conventional wisdom. Over time, I realized that there are other folks not aligned with conventional wisdom. I also realized that minority opinion is not necessarily wrong. Hence, this attempt at expressing minority opinions and triggering some discussion. Expect most topics to be related to software engineering.

BTW, quoting from https://definitions.uslegal.com/: "A minority opinion is an opinion by one or more judges in a legal case who disagree with the decision reached by the majority."
