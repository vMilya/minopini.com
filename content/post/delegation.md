The first advice a new manager gets is to avoid micromanagement. They are advised to delegate the work, empower their team, and get out of the way. The challenges with micromanagement are well known. Providing excessive direction to the team and/or constantly monitoring their every move, can stifle creativity, demotivate individuals, and hinder their professional growth. Delegation is an essential skill for managers, enabling them to distribute workload, foster team development, and focus on strategic responsibilities. By entrusting tasks to your team, you cultivate a sense of ownership, accountability, and professional growth. On the other hand, "overdelegation" also has pitfalls that need to be considered. Handing over tasks entirely without considering the experience and expertise of team members can lead to subpar results, missed deadlines, and increased stress levels. It assumes a one-size-fits-all approach that neglects individual strengths and weaknesses.

This dilemma between micromanagement and delegation can be solved through a flexible leadership approach that recognizes the varying needs and capabilities of team members. It involves adapting your leadership style to suit the specific task and the individual's competence. This approach was formalized as "Situational Leadership" by Blanchard and Hersey in their classic book Management of Organizational Behavior. Situational leadership advises four levels of delegation:

a. Directing: Provide specific instructions and closely supervise individuals who are new to a task or lack experience. Offer clear guidance and feedback to ensure successful outcomes.

b. Coaching: Support and guide team members who have some experience but may still require additional assistance. Offer feedback, ask open-ended questions, and encourage their development.

c. Supporting: Team members who possess the necessary skills but lack confidence or motivation can benefit from support. Show trust, provide resources, and be available for guidance and encouragement.

d. Delegating: Entrust tasks to experienced and capable individuals who demonstrate a high level of competence. Provide autonomy, set expectations, and offer support when needed, while allowing them to take ownership and excel.

As a people manager, finding the right balance between micromanagement and complete delegation is crucial. By employing situational leadership, you can tailor your approach based on each team member's experience and capabilities. Situational leadership ensures optimal outcomes for every task, at the same time, unlocks your team's full potential.
