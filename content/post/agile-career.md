*Disclaimer: This is not about "Agile Software Development" even though two of the three words match. If you are looking for "Agile Software Development", you will find the best content [here](https://martinfowler.com/).*

The Japanese concept of Ikigai helps you understand your life's purpose. Ikigai is the intersection of four sets:

1. What you love to do
1. What you are good at
1. What you can be paid for
1. What the world needs 

This simple concept becomes difficult to implement in some cases:
1. If you are not sure about the answer to these questions, especially the first two. 
1. The intersection set is empty.
1. If you "want" to do something that you know is different than the intersection. Most of the times, it is about getting paid more for something that you do not love and/or you are not good at.
1. If you "want" to do something that you have not tried before and hence, you do not know whether it's part of the intersection. Most of the times, it's about a a role that you did not play in the past and you do not know whether you will like it and you can do it well.

We will try address #4 here (because I don't know how to address the first 3 :)
